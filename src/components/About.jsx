        </h2>

        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
          I am a self-taught MERN Stack Developer with hands-on experience in
          building and deploying full-stack web applications. I have worked
          extensively with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I am
          comfortable building REST APIs with JWT authentication.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
          Before transitioning into web development, I worked as a Digital
          Marketing Executive, which helped me develop a strong understanding
          of user-focused and business-driven applications. I am currently
          seeking an entry-level full-stack or backend development role.
